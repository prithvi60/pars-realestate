      review: `Prior to choosing Intermont, we walked through numerous new construction homes. After seeing Intermont, it was clear that the quality and attention to detail was next level. It was great co-ordination with Mr.Lokesh throughout the construction process. They were easy to get in touch with and quick to respond to any questions that came up. They were on time, within the budget, and listened to our needs.
      We would certainly recommend Intermont, and Thank you Mr.Lokesh for helping take our dream and make it a reality!!
      Best Wishes,
      M.Sathish`,

      review: ` Owning a House is everyone's biggest dream in our lives.  At that point of juncture, we really look for someone who is loyal, reliable, trustable, supportive, and flexible in achieving our dreams.   

    My search was fruitful when I met Mr. Lokesh, who focuses on great customer service, flexible and always been polite.  He really took us the entire journey of buying my Flat smoothly and made us to be one of the proud flat owners of Imperial.
    
    The level of construction, fittings and accessories used were premium, trendy, and looks like a star-ranked flats.
    
    Mr. Lokesh gesture is well appreciated and for my future ventures I will definitely partner with Intermont team needless to say.`,
